* Introduction

Hi, I’m P’undrak (pronounced {{{phon(pʰynɖak̚)}}}), also known as Lucien
Cartier-Tilet. I create constructed languages and worlds, both for fun
and for my literary universe. As you might have guessed with the name
of this website, you will find here the documentation of my public
constructed languages. If you want to know more about me, you can head
to my [[https://phundrak.com/en][main website]].

Each language is published in three different formats:
- *a web version*, which you can read online on this website
- *a PDF version*, although it might be a bit outdated compared to the
  web version
- *an EPUB version* when I remember to publish the language in this
  format. You can easily convert it to the MOBI format if your digital
  reader doesn’t support the EPUB format.

I am currently publicly working on two languages:
- [[file:./proto-nyqy.org][Proto-Ñyqy]] (formerly known as /Ñyqy/) is an /a priori/ protolang I am developing
  in order to create a whole conlang family.

  - [[file:./proto-nyqy.pdf][PDF version]]
  - [[file:./proto-nyqy.epub][EPUB version]]

- [[file:./eittlandic.org][Eittlandic]], an /a posteriori/ language developed from Old Norse, the
  language spoken by vikings about a millennium ago. Eittlandic
  evolved from it isolated from the continent on its own island.

  - [[file:./eittlandic.pdf][PDF version]]
  - [[file:./eittlandic.epub][EPUB version]]

** Inactive Development

All my documents in French are currently inactive, and I do not plan
on working on them again. They include:
- Proto-Ñyqy (French version)
- Eittlandic (French version)
- Hjelp, an /a priori/ kitchen sink language
- Mattér, the precursor to Eittlandic.
