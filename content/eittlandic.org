where the Eittlandic Kingdom actually exists in our world, with its
history intertwined with ours. Any vague part about any linguistical
or cultural aspect is most likely due to a lack of worldbuilding, so
if you read something along the lines of “more research needs to be

** A Warning to the Reader
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Foreword-A-Warning-to-the-Reader-aov3x130rbj0
:END:
This document deals with the evolution of a real historic language
towards a completely made up language, as well as the evolution of a
similarly made up people in a made up country. I am no linguist,
ethnologist, nor historian, and making this requires a lot of
knowledge which I don’t have (if anything, you could consider me an
armchair linguists: I read lots of books on the subject). Therefore, I
*will* take shortcuts here and there on various topics.

Any “fact” you might learn about the Old Norse people, language, or
history might be altered reality if not straight up wrong, although I
do try to strive to achieve something believable and as close as I can
to reality.

Let me reiterate: I am no expert in the subjects presented here, do
not take anything I say at face value. I believe the scientific term
for some stuff written here is “bullshit”.

This is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to persons living or dead,
to any real event, or any real people is purely coincidental.

* Eittland
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Eittland-iz98ngl0jaj0
:END:
Eittland (Eittlandic: Eittland {{{rune(eittland)}}} {{{phon(ɑɪtlɑ̃d)}}}) is part of
the family of Nordic countries, with a population of 31.5 millions as
per the 2019 national census. It has a superficy of 121 km^{2}, making it
the second largest island in Europe after Great Britain. Its capital
Đeberget is the largest eittlandic city with a population of 1.641.600
in 2019. The island is naturally separated in two, its western and
eastern sides, by a chain of volcanoes spawning on the separation of
the North American and the Eurasian plates, much like its northern
sister Iceland. Thus, its Eastern side covers 49km^{2} of the island and
hosts 11.3 million inhabitants while the western side covers 72km^{2}
with a population of 20.1 millions.

** Geography
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Eittland-Geography-gox58hn0jaj0
:END:
Eittland is an active volcanic island. In its center we can find the
most active volcanoes, surrounded by glaciers and some regular
mountains. It is surrounded by some taiga, taiga plains covered mainly
by ashen pines (/pinus fraxinus/), and a large cold desert covering most
of the center of the island and its northern eastern part. Outside of
this largely unpopulated region, Eastern Eittland mainly consists of
grasslands with some temperate rainforests on its southern shores as
well as some occasional wetland and marshes. On the other hand,
Western Eittland has a lot more temperate deciduos forests, temperate
rainforests and some more wetlands and marshes still. Three small cold
deserts spawn in Western Eittland, including one north east of
Đeberget not far from the city. More details can be found in the map
[[img:map-biomes]]. Overall, the southern and western parts of Eittland
can be compared to Scotland in terms of temperatures, or a warmer
Iceland.

Eastern Eittland is also recognizable by its great amount of flat
shorelines, especially in its northern and eastern parts which are part
of the more recent paths of lava flows. On the other hand, its few
fjords and the numerous fjords found in the western part of the island
are characteristic of much older parts of Eittland. The Fjord
themselves were formed during the last ice age, while the smoother
shore lines formed since. Western Eittland also has two main bays
which are two very old caldeira volcanoes. It is not known whether
they will be one day active again or not.

** Culture
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Eittland-Culture-q6uf2gs0uaj0
:END:
The Eittlandic people share a common basis for their culture which
remained rather conservative for much longer than the other nordic
people due to its resistance towards Christianity conversion. The
number of people adhering to Norse beliefs remained very high through
the ages and only recently began declining, going from 93% of
Eittlanders declaring themselves follower of the Norse Faith in 1950
to 68% in 2019. This decline is also due to either people converting
to a religion or due to the immigration boom from the last seventy
years, though the main reason is the decline in people identifying to
any faith at all --- the number of atheists went from only 2% of
Eittlanders in 1940 to 15% in 2019. The evolution of the religious
population is shown in the chart [[chart:religions]], and a geographical
distribution of these in 2019 can be found in the map [[map:religion]] ---
note that only the main religion is shown in a particular area and
religions with less people in said area are not shown. You can also
see on said map the population repartition of Eittland.

There is also a regional cultural difference between Western, Eastern,
and Southern Eittland marked with some differences in traditions and
language. There is currently a nationalist movement in Southern
Eittland so a new state is created within the Kingdom of Eittland. The

Standard Eittlandic is a relatively young language, created in the
1960s by the government in order to create a standard dialect to
facilitate communications between Eittlanders and make learning the
language easier. Standard Eittlandic is now enforced as the /de facto/
legal language of the High Kingdom of Eittland, used by its
government, schools, and universities, but the local dialects are
still widely spoken privately and in business which remains regional.
They still have a strong presence in popular media and are still
spoken by younger generations, however, a decline has been registered
since the 90s among young people living in cities, speaking more and
more in Standard Eittlandic instead. Dialects are also rarely used on
the internet outside of private conversation. An estimate of 17% of
the Eittlandic population younger than 25 in 2017 do not speak any
dialectal Eittlandic outside of Standard Eittlandic, although only 2%
of them do not understand their family’s dialectal Eittlandic.
Standard Eittlandic also became the default dialect for Eittlandic
communities living outside of Eittland --- in these communities the
inability of speaking other dialects rise to 61% while the ability to
understand them rises to 25% among Eittlanders younger than 25 in 2018
and who still have Eittlandic as their mother tongue.

It is estimated only 0.05% of people living in Eittland do not speak
any Eittlandic dialect, all of them being immigrants or children of
immigrants. It is therefore safe to say Eittlandic is still going
strong and does not face any risk of disappearing anytime soon,
although we might be at the start of the decline of the historical
dialects of Eittland in favor of Standard Eittlandic.

In this document, you will see references to both Standard Eittlandic
and Modern Eittlandic. Although some people use the terms
interchangeably, they are not. /Standard Eittlandic/ refers to the
official dialect described above, while /Modern Eittlandic/ refers to
all modern dialects of Eittlandic. This document focuses on Modern
Eittlandic in general, and when details about specific dialects are
given, the name of said dialect will be shared.

** Name of the Country
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Eittland-Name-of-the-Country-hun23je06bj0
:END:
The root of the name of “Eittland” is the accusative of /einn/ (Old
Norse /one/, /alone/) and /land/ (Old Norse /country/, /land/. This is due to
how remote it seemed to the people who discovered, before Iceland and
Greenland were known. Hence, a possible translation of “Eittland” can
be /Lonely Land/. The term “Eittlandic” is relatively transparent
considering the term “Icelandic” for “Iceland” and “Greenlandic” for
“Greenland”.

** History

:CUSTOM_ID: Eittland-History-9n168hn0jaj0
:END:

*** Early Eittlandic History (7th-12th centuries)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Eittland-History-Early-Eittlandic-History-dgxi3s21mej0
:END:
According to historical records, Eittland was first found in 763 by
Norwegian explorers. Its first settlement appeared in 782 on its
eastern shores with hopes of finding new farmland. The population grew
rapidly after the discovery of the southern shores, and in 915
Eittland became self-governing with Ásmundr Úlfsonn declared the first
Eittlandic king. However, in order to avoid any unnecessary conflicts,
the new king swore allegiance to the Norwegian king Harald I
Halfdansson. Eittland thus became a vassal state to the Norwegian
crown while retaining autonomy from it, which was granted due to the
distance between the two countries.

Shortly after however, the beginning of the christianisation of the
nordic countries and especially of Norway created a new immigration
boost in Eittland with norsemen seeking a pagan land untouched by
christian faith. In 935, a year after Haakon I Haraldsson became king
of Norway and began trying to introduce Christianity to its people,
the newly crowned king Áleifr I Ásmundson of Eittland adopted a new
law forbidding the Christian faith to be imported, promoted, and
practiced in Eittland. This decision forever weakened the alliance
between the two countries and detariorated their relationship.

As more and more people in Eittland were moving to its western part
due to larger opportunities with its farmlands, king Áleifr I chose in
936 to move the capital of Eittland from Hylfjaltr to Đeberget and
split in half the country. He appointed his brother Steingrímr, later
known as Steingrímr I Áleifsbróðr, as his co-ruler and gave him
authority over Eastern Eittland while he kept ruling himself over
Western Eittland. This choice is due to the difficulty of going from
one side of the island to the other by land --- lava flows often
forcefully close and destroy paths joining the two parts together.
This gave birth to the two states of the Kingdom of Đeberget (also
called the /Western Eittlandic Kingdom/) and the Kingdom of Hylfjaltr
(also called the /Eastern Eittlandic Kingdom/). More on that in
§[[#Eittland-Political-Organization-z5v4e9p0jaj0]].

*** Crusades and Independence (13th century - 1407)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Eittland-History-Crusades-and-Independence-377j3s21mej0
:END:
As soon as the 13th century, and through the 14th century, the
Teutonic Order and the Livonian Order, backed by the Holy Roman
Empire, proposed crusades against Eittland to get rid of its norse
faith. However, these never came to be due to the distance between
Eittland and mainland Europe, despite the papal authorisations in
1228, 1257, 1289, 1325, and 1367.

In 1397, the creation of the Kalmar Union kicked a new crusade, this
time backed by the Union itself as well as the Teutonic Order --- Eric
of Pomerania aimed to unify his country both religiously by getting
rid of the norse faith in Eittland and politically by getting rid of
its established monarchy. A contingent sailed to Eittland to submit
the island, however they were met with fierce resistance by the locals
on arrival. Estimates show that while some 2.400 Eittlandic people
died during this first invasion, most of the 3.000 men sent were
either killed or taken prisoners.

In 1398, a new contingent of 12.000 men landed in Eittland. This time,
a much more prepared army of 14.000 men faced them on a battlefield
east of the eastern capital of Hyfjaltr. This resulted in an
Eittlandic victory, however the Monarch of Hylfjaltr Eiríkr IV
Ásgeirsbróðr lost his life during the battle. Coincidentally, the High
King Ásgeirr I Biœrgson died of unknown causes around the same time.
Historians still debate whether it is due to the ongoing conflict, and
if it is by who. Theories range from poisoning by spies from the
Kalmar Union, to assassination by the next rulers, to a much more
simple, unknown health condition which coincided with the ongoing
events.

During the same year, the Althing elected Arvid I Geirson as the new
High King who nominated his brother Havardr I Arvidbróðr as the
Monarch of Hylfjaltr. While the previous monarchs took a more
defensive approach, they chose to become much more aggressive,
striving for independence. After demands were sent to the Kalmar
Union, Eittland began a series of raids on its territories, ranging
from Iceland to the Faroese Islands to even two raids in Norway and
Denmark. These raids only aimed trade and military ships but severely
handicaped the Union’s marine.

On September 17th, 1400 High King Arvid Geirson and King Erik met in
Reykjavik to sign the Treaty of Reykjavik, during which the Kalmar
Union recognized the independence of Eittland and renounced its claims
to the island. Both parties agreed to end the hostilities towards one
another.

While the Union no longer launched any crusades against Eittland, the
Teutonic Order attempted to land again in 1407 with 4.000 men.
Although the Kingdom of Hylfjaltr took a devastating blow during the
initial days of the crusade, loosing well over 6.000 men, the invaders
were ultimately defeated thanks to reinforcement from the Kingdom of
Ðeberget. This marked the end of crusades in Eittland.

*** Kingdoms and Monarchy
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Eittland-Political-Organization-Political-subdivisions-z32drvy0jaj0
:END:
While Eittland is a single country, it is host to two kingdoms: the
Kingdom of Đeberget in the western part of the country, and the
Kingdom of Hylfjaltr in its eastern part. This is due to a separation
of the country in two halves during the reign of Eittlands second king
Áleifr I when he realized the difficulties he and the following
monarchs of the island would face trying to rule the country alone
while the latter is almost always split in two by active volcanoes.
Thus, while the two kingdoms operate very independently from each
other --- each have their own policies on economics, education,
industry, and so on --- they also operate in cooperation as the
Eittlandic High Kingdom with the king of Đeberget at its head when it
comes to common policies, such as military decision and internrational
affairs.
#+attr_html: :loading lazy
#+attr_latex: :float sideways
#+CAPTION: The Two Eittlandic States
#+NAME: img:map-political
[[file:./img/eittlandic/map-political.png]]

This means that while both governments are independent from each other
and are legally equals to each other, the western monarch is the one
with the authority to decide on national actions after negotiations
between them and the eastern monarch. This is reflected by the throne
rooms found in official buildings such as the royal palaces where
three thrones can be found: a central, very large throne surrounded by
two other identical thrones, the right one for the monarch of
Hylfjaltr and the left one for the king of Đeberget. Most of the time,
both monarchs sit on their side throne, including when they meet each
other as the monarchs of Hylfjaltr and Đeberget. However, when the
monarch of Đeberget is meant to act as the High Monarch of Eittland,
they step up to the central throne and then represent the country as a
whole.

At the end of the reign of the High King, either through abdication or
their death, his successor is enthroned within a month. Then, within a
year, the new High King has to appoint a new monarch for Hylfjaltr.
Traditionally, the new co-ruler is a brother of the current High
Monarch, however history showed it could be sometimes an uncle, a son,
a sister or even sometimes a daughter. When the eastern monarch either
abdicates or dies, the High Monarch has a month to designate a new
one.

Up until the 14th century, the monarch of Hylfjaltr was rarely the
successor of the High Monarch. However, High King Ólafr I changed this
tradition and created a new one. He named his brother and co-ruler
King of Eittland and his son Prince of Eittland. From here on, the
King (or occasionally the Queen) of Eastern Eittland was meant to
become the new High Monarch of Eittland and make the Prince (or
occasional Princess) the ruler of Hylfjaltr. Then, once the reign of
the King ends, the Prince becomes the new High King and nominates a
new King and a new Prince. This was done to ensure the upcoming High
Monarch would be prepared in ruling the whole country by first ruling
the state. If anything were to happen to the Prince or Princess of
Eittland while the King or Queen of Hylfjaltr is on the throne, they
would have to nominate a new heir among the other possible heirs
possible for the late High Monarch.

When the High Monarchs steps up to the central throne, they may
designate someone to fill in the role of the monarch of Đeberget for
the time being. They can also authorize the monarch of Hylfjaltr to do
so in case they are unavailable and someone need to represent the
country in front of foreign representatives. The last example was
during the two last years of Eríkr IX’s reign from 1987 to 1989 when
he could not act as High King due to his illness. While he did not
abdicate, he authorized king Harald III to act as High King while he
appointed his daughter and present-day High Queen Njall III as the
acting monarch of Đeberget.

*** Regions and Jarldoms
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Eittland-Political-Organization-Regions-and-Jarldoms-vxsav301jaj0
:END:
While each kingdom is ruled by a monarch and the country is ruled by
the High Monarch, the kingdoms are divided into several kinds of
subdivisions. The most common one is the jarldom, historically ruled
by and still represented by a jarl during ceremonies. “Jarl”
translates as “Earl” in English, and they were the nobles in charge of
managing parts of the land in the name of the ruler.
#+attr_html: :loading lazy
#+attr_latex: :float sideways
#+CAPTION: Eittlandic Provinces
#+NAME: img:map-provinces
[[file:./img/eittlandic/map-provinces.png]]

Some parts of the land are directly under the control of the crown,
such as the districts of Đeberget and Hylfjaltr, which the ruler ruled
without intermediaries. They are the private possessions of the family
of the rulers.

On top of this the center of the island is divided in territories, one
administered by the government of Đeberget and two by the government
of Hylfjaltr. These territories are supposedly not inhabited by anyone
and are currently natural parks. This is mostly where you can find the
mountains and volcanoes of Eittland as well as its cold deserts.

Due to the Last Royal Decree of 1826, jarls no longer rule their
jarldom themselves anymore. Instead, a local elected government takes
care of this role now.

**** Monarchy and Things
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Eittland-Political-Organization-Governments-Monarchy-and-Things-f4i3ii11jaj0
:END:
The first form of government created in Eittland revolved around
Things (/þing/ in Eittlandic), assemblies of varying size occasionally
created at various levels of the state to decide on important matters,
with the Althing being the highest Thing to exist in Eittland. The
Things allow at first any adult man to participate, but as the
population grew some restrictions were put in place in order to limit
the amount of participants. Only one man could represent a household
starting from 982. Then, starting from 998, only jarls were allowed to
the ruler’s Thing, and only ten jarls from each kingdom, elected among
all the jarls from the same kingdom, would be allowed to attend the
High Monarch’s Thing. These jarls would then act as representatives of
the kingdom to the High King and his counsellors.

In 1278, the first formal ministry (or department) was created in the
Ðeberget Kingdom, called a /Ráðuneyt/ (litt. “fellowship of
counsellors”) with a /Ráðunautr/ at its head, to aid the King Hallþórr V
Gunhildson’s in administering agriculture. The Hylfjaltr Kingdom soon
followed, creating its own in 1283 by order of Eyvindor III
Steingrímson. From then, ráðuneyts were created as needed with a
growing number.

**** Constitutional Monarchy
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Eittland-Political-Organization-Governments-Constitutional-Monarchy-k7y3ii11jaj0
:END:
In 1826, fearing the revolutionary climate in mainland Europe, Ólafr V
passed the appropriately named “Last Royal Decree” in 1826. This act
put in place a new form of government based on the British monarchy.

The king transfers all the royal power from the rulers of Đeberget and
Hylfjaltr to the House of the People and the House of the Land (the
equivalent of the lower and upper Houses respectively). The House of
the People is composed of men elected during general elections every
eight years. It was decided for each jarldom and district, one
representative would be elected plus another one for each percentage
of the population of the kingdom the jarldom represents.

A similar system was created for jarldoms in order to replace jarls
with locally elected governments, as well as the organisation of
municipalities.

At first only male land owner of the Nordic Faith could vote and could
be elected. In 1886, all men of the Nordic Faith got the right to vote
and be elected in the general elections. In 1902, women gained the
right to vote and they gained the right to be elected in 1915. The law
that allowed women to vote also made the authorities stop enforcing
the restriction on the faith of the participants --- while the
original texts of 1826 and 1886 were clear on the fact only men of the
Nordic Faith were allowed to vote and be elected, women had no such
restriction making it unclear if it only applied to women or if this
restriction was revoked for everyone. Organizers of the next elections
in 1914 chose not to enforce this religious restriction and ever since
then. In 1998, Queen Siv I exceptionally used her powers of High Queen
to pass a law to clarify this issue and formally make Eittland a
non-religious country. This also removed the long unenforced ban on
other religions in Eittland.

Note that while the rulers of Đeberget and Hylfjaltr have lost all
their power with the “Last Royal Decree”, the High Monarch remained
unaffected by the text though they act and are expected to act as if
it were the case. To replace them, the eastern and western governments
elect a single national representative meant to act as the head of
both states instead of the High Monarch who now holds only a
ceremonial position. However, it happens from time to time the High
Monarch passes a law, although they only write down in the law already
well established traditions, such as the ban on the religious
restrictions for voters which had not been enforced for almost a
century by that point.

Today, Ráðuneyts still exist, but their head is no longer designated
by the monarch but by the head of the House of the People. Here is the
list of Ministries that exist in Eittland in 2022:
- /Bærráðuneyt/ :: Agriculture Ministry
- Dæmaráðuneyt :: Justice Ministry
- Erlendslandsráðuneyt :: Foreign Affair Ministry
- Fræðiráðuneyt :: Education Ministry
- Heilsráðuneyt :: Health Ministry
- Konungdómráðuneyt :: Kingdom’s Ministry (State Affairs)
- Náttúrráðuneyt :: Nature Ministry (including ecology)
- Rógráðuneyt :: War Ministry
- Teknikráðuneyt :: Technology Ministry
- Kaupráðuneyt :: Economy Ministry
- Vinnaráðuneyt :: Employment Ministry

With the separation of the State with its religious departments
following the law of 1998, the /Heiðniráðuneyt/ (the Heathendom
Department) became an entity separate from the Government. Its
Ráðunautr used to be exceptionally appointed by the House of the Land,
unlike the rest of Ráðunautrs.

Over the last centuries, Eittlandic evolved to become a language
leaning more and more towards an analytic language, losing its
fusional aspect Old Eittlandic once had. It grammar now greatly relies
on its syntax as well as on grammatical particules rather than on its
morphology. Let’s take the following sentence as an example.

1. barn fisk etar / a child is eating a fish
   | barn      | fisk     | et-ar   |
   | child.NOM | fish.ACC | eat-3sg |

subject of the sentence while its subject is /fisk/, although we have no
information on their number; the sentence could also very well mean
/children are eating fishes/. Unlike in Old Eittlandic where we could
have the following sentences.

1. barn fiska etar
   | barn      | fisk-a      | et-ar   |
   | child.NOM | fish-pl.ACC | eat-3sg |
2. fiska barn etar
   | fisk-a      | barn      | et-ar   |
   | fish-pl.ACC | child.NOM | eat-3sg |

Both have the same meaning as the Eittlandic sentence. However, the
near-complete (or even complete in Standard Eittlandic) loss of case
marking makes the sentence /fisk barn etar/ much more gruesome.

1. fisk barn etar / a fish is eating a child
   | fisk     | barn     | et-ar   |
   | fish.NOM | barn.ACC | eat-3sg |

Eittlandic is now a SOV language with a much stricter word order than
it used to be. This is an important change since Old Eittlandic which
main word order was VSO instead. For instance, here is the same
sentence in Old Eittlandic and in Modern Eittlandic, meaning /he
carried him to some lake/.
- Old Eittlandic :: Han bar hann til vatns nákkurs
  | han    | bar            | han-n     | til | vatn-s   | nákkur-s |
  | he.NOM | carry.3sg.pret | 3sg.m-ACC | to  | lake-DAT | some-DAT |
- Modern Eittlandic :: Han til vatn nákkur hann bar
  | han       | til | vatn | nákkur | hann   | bar            |
  | 3sg.m.NOM | to  | lake | some   | he.ACC | carry.3sg.pret |

Eittlandic still retains VSO word order in its relative and
interrogative clauses, as shown below.
- Han mér talð þat kom han hér í gær / he told me he came here yesterday
  | han       | mér     | tal-ð         | þat  | kom           | han       | hér  | í gær     |
  | 3sg.m.NOM | 1sg.DAT | tell-3sg.PRET | that | come.3sg.PRET | 3sg.m.NOM | here | yesterday |

Loss of case marking also affected adjectives which share most of
their declensions with nouns. The parts where Eittlandic retains its
fusional aspect is with verbs, where loss of its words’ final vowel
had much less impact, as we could see in /barn fisk etar/. In this case,
/etar/ is the third person singular declension of the verb /et/, a weak
verb.

:END:
Eittlandic evolved early on from Early Old Norse, and as such some
vowels it evolved from are different than the Old Norse vowels and
consonants some other Nordic languages evolved from. In this chapter,
we will see the main list of attested phonetic evolution Eittlandic
lived through.

The history of Eittlandic goes from the late 8th century until
modern-day Eittlandic. Its history is divided as shown on table
[[table:history-eittlandic-language]]. It is not an exact science though
as changes happened progressively through the country. Changes were
also progressive, meaning the dates chosen to go from one language to
the other are relatively arbitrary. In evolution examples, it will be
indicated whether the Eittlandic pronunciation is specific to a
certain time area (with /Early Middle Eittlandic/, /Late Old Eittlandic/,
etc…) but if it only specifies /Eittlandic/ it means no significant
changes in pronunciation occurred since the phonetic rule shown.
Meaning is also shown between parenthesis. In case of semantic shift,
its new meaning in Eittlandic is shown --- the same goes for the
word’s spelling.

#+name: table:history-eittlandic-language
#+caption: Linguistic eras of Eittland
| Period                      | Language          |

| 13th century - 16th century | Middle Eittlandic |
| 17th century - today        | Modern Eittlandic |

It is generally considered the gj-shift of the 13th century is the
evolution that marks the change from Old Eittlandic to Middle
Eittlandic while the great vowel shift marks the change from Middle
Eittlandic to Modern Eittlandic between the 16th and the 17th century.

One of the first evolution of the Eittlandic was the evolution of the
{{{phon(hʷ)}}} into a {{{phon(ʍ)}}} (written <hv>). It differs from other nordic
languages which evolved their {{{phon(hʷ)}}} into a {{{phon(v)}}}, like in
Icelandic or in Norwegian. However, this evolution is cause to debate,
mainly due to the original phoneme {{{phon(hʷ)}}} which could be inherited
from Proto-Norse instead.

When preceded by a {{{phon(h)}}}, word-initial consonants such as <l>, <r>,
<n> would lose their voicing and become voiceless consonants. Note
<hj> went to {{{phon(ç)}}}.

+ Example ::
  - Early Old Norse /hlóð/ (/hearth/) {{{phon(hloːð)}}} > Old Eittlandic /hlóð/
    {{{phon(l̥oːð)}}}
  - Early Old-Norse /hneisa/ (/shame, disgrace/) {{{phon(hneisɑ)}}} > Early Old
    Eittlandic {{{phon(n̥eisɑ)}}}

In word-initial position and followed by a vowel or when between
vowels, Early Old Norse {{{phon(g)}}} gets palatalized into a {{{phon(ɣ)}}}.

When finishing a word, short unaccented vowels disappeared.
Historically, they first went through a weakening transforming them
into a {{{phon(ə)}}}, but they eventually disappeared before long vowels got
affected by the first part of the rule. However, it did not apply to
final vowels following a <j>.

+ Example :: Old Norse /heilsa/ (/health/) {{{phon(heilsɑ)}}} > Late Old
  Eittlandic /heils/ {{{phon(heils)}}}.

Reflecting this change, the last vowel got lost in the Eittlandic
orthography. However, this rule did not get applied consistently with
a good deal of people that kept them well until the [[#Great-Vowel-Shift-7spk7j70uaj0][Great Vowel Shift]].

While the final short vowel of words did not disappear when preceded
by a <j>, they still weakened to a schwa.

schwa.

+ Example :: Old Norse /erþó/ (as though) {{{phon(erθoː)}}} > Late Old
  Eittlandic {{{phon(erθə)}}}.

Notice how in the modern orthography the <ó> didn’t get lost, unlike
with the previous rule. Unlike the schwa from the previous rule, the
current schwa still bears the long vowel feature although it is not
pronounced anymore by that point, influencing the rule described in §[[#Structural-Overview-Phonetic-Inventory-and-Translitteration-Evolution-from-Early-Old-Norse-to-Eittlandic-ə-C-voice-ysvblnk08bj0]].

During the 13th century, continued palatalization of the letter <g>
when beginning or preceding a vowel transformed it from {{{phon(g)}}} in
Proto-Norse to {{{phon(ɣ)}}} in Old Eittlandic to {{{phon(j)}}} in Early Modern
Eittlandic.

+ Example :: Old Norse /gauð/ (a barking) {{{phon(gɑuð)}}} > Early Middle
  Eittlandic /gauð/ (a barking, a quarrel) {{{phon(jɑuð)}}}.

the schwa resulting from it kept its long vowel feature although it
wasn’t pronounced anymore. This resulted in the current rule making
all schwas resulting from short vowels at the end of words to

**** Great Vowel Shift
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Great-Vowel-Shift-7spk7j70uaj0
:END:
The great vowel shift happened during the 16th and 17th century during
which long vowels underwent a length loss, transforming them into
different short vowels. Only three rules governed this shift:
- V[+high +long] > V[-high -long]
- V[+tense +long] > V[-tense -long]
- V[-tense +long] > V[-long -low]

Hence, the vowels evolved as shown in table [[vow:eittland:evolution]].
#+name: vow:eittland:evolution

| ý           | {{{phon(yː)}}}             | {{{phon(ø)}}}                 |

As you can see, some overlap is possible from Old Norse vowels and
Modern Eittlandic vowels. For instance, Eittlanders will read <e> and
<í> both as an {{{phon(e)}}}.

+ Examples ::
  - Middle Eittlandic /sjá/ (/to see/) {{{phon(ʃɑː)}}} > Modern Eittlandic {{{phon(ʃɛ)}}}
  - Old Norse /fé/ (/cattle/) {{{phon(feː)}}} > Modern Eittlandic /fé/ (wealth) {{{phon(fɛ)}}}
  - Late Proto-Norse /hví/ (/why/) {{{phon(hʷiː)}}} > Modern Eittlandic {{{phon(ʍe)}}}
  - Old Norse /bók/ (/beech/, /book/) {{{phon(boːk)}}} > Modern Eittlandic (/book/)
    {{{phon(bɔk)}}}
  - Early Old Norse /œgir/ (/frightener/, /terrifier/) {{{phon(øːɡir)}}} > Modern
    Eittlandic /Œgir/ (a kind of mythical beast) {{{phon(œjir)}}}
  - Middle Eittlandic /úlv/ (/wolf/) {{{phon(uːlv)}}} > Modern Eittlandic {{{phon(olv)}}}

Diphthongs also evolved following these rules:
- {{{phon(ei)}}} > {{{phon(ɑɪ)}}}
- {{{phon(ou)}}} > {{{phon(ɔʊ)}}}
- {{{phon(øy)}}} > {{{phon(œʏ)}}}

When preceding a nasal, any vowel that is not high as determined by
the figure [[tree:vowels]] gets nasalized when preceding a nasal consonant
and loses its tenseness if it has any. Hence, the pronunciation of the
<a> in /Eittland/ is {{{phon(ã)}}}. However, Old Norse /runa/ (rune) {{{phon(runɑ)}}}
becomes /run/ (letter, character, rune) {{{phon(run)}}} without any
nasalization.

Note this evolution is mostly proeminent in the southern regions of
Eittland and the city of Hundraðskip. It is less often documented in
Eastern Eittland and almost undocumented in Western Eittland. It is
more often documented in casual conversation buch rarer in formal
conversation, especially when the majority of the speakers in a group
are not southerners.

Eittlandic is a language in which three distinct main dialects exist
with their own accent. These three main dialects are Eastern
Eittlandic spoken in the majority Kingdom of Hylfjaltr, Western
Eittlandic spoken in the majority of the Kingdom of Ðeberget, and
Southern Eittlandic spoken on the southern parts of the island,
regardess of the legal kingdom (see the map shown in
§[[#Eittland-Culture-q6uf2gs0uaj0]]. Three main elements of their
respective accent were presented above in
§§[[#Evolution-from-Early-Old-Norse-to-Eittlandic-r-ʁ-Eastern-Eittlandic-b20i1pm0bbj0]],
[[#Evolution-from-Early-Old-Norse-to-Eittlandic-V-N-Ṽ-V-high-ulb1ey80uaj0]],
and
[[#Evolution-from-Early-Old-Norse-to-Eittlandic-V-U-ə-diphthongs-fjh0pnr0uaj0]].

Some regional variation can be also found in these dialects, although
less significant and less consistantly than the changes mentioned
above. As such, we can find in some rural parts of the Eastern
Eittlandic dialect area high vowels slightly more open than their
equivalent in Standard Eittlandic, as shown in table [[vow:accent:east]]
#+name: vow:accent:east

|         {{{phon(u)}}}          |       {{{phon(ʊ)}}}       |

On the other hand, Southern Eittlandic tends to front its {{{phon(ɑ)}}} into
{{{phon(a)}}} after nasal consonants and glides and into {{{phon(ɐ)}}} otherwise.

**** Cases in Modern Eittlandic
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Structural-Overview-Structure-of-a-Nominal-Group-Grammatical-Case-Cases-in-Modern-Eittlandic-jufb9o11mfj0
:END:
Although seldom visible, as described in
§[[#Structural-Overview-Structure-of-a-Nominal-Group-Grammatical-Case-Case-Marking-c6jb9o11mfj0]],
cases still remain part of the Eittlandic grammar, expressed through
its syntax rather than explicit marking on its nouns and adjectives.
Four different grammatical cases exist in this language: the
*nominative*, *accusative*, *genitive*, and *dative* case.
- The *nominative* case represents the subject of a sentence, that is,
  the subject of intransitive clauses and the agent of transitive
  clauses. As we’ll see below, it is morphologically marked only in
  dialects other than Standard Eittlandic, and only if the word is a
  strong masculine word.
- On the other hand *accusative*, like Old Norse, usually marks the
  object of a verb, but it can also express time-related ideas such as
  a duration in time, or after some prepositions. It is also the
  default case when a noun has no clear status in a clause, and it can
  as such serve as a vocative.
- *Dative* usually marks indirect objects of verbs in Old Norse, though
  it can also often mark direct objects depending on the verb used.

**** Case Marking
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Structural-Overview-Structure-of-a-Nominal-Group-Grammatical-Case-Case-Marking-c6jb9o11mfj0
:END:
Although present in Early Old Norse, the use of grammatical cases has
been on the decline since the Great Vowel Shift (see
§[[#Great-Vowel-Shift-7spk7j70uaj0]]). Due to the general loss of
word-final short vowels and to regularization of its nouns, Eittlandic
lost almost all of weak nouns’ inflexions and a good amount in its
strong nouns’ inflexions. On top of this, the root of most nouns got
regularized, getting rid of former umlauts. Hence, while in Old Norse
one might find the table [[tbl:old-norse-noun-inflexions]] presented in
Cleasby and Vigfusson (1874), Modern Eittlandic is simplified to the
table [[tbl:eittlandic-example-noun-inflexions]].

As you can see, grammatica cases disappeared in singular nominative
(except for strong mascuine nouns), accusative, and dative as well as
in plural accusative and genitive. The only markers remaining are for
singular genitive, plural nominative and dative as well as singular
nominative for strong masculine words. Note however that strong nouns
are no longer productive and get slowly replaced with weak nouns.

Note also how the last column in table
[[tbl:eittlandic-example-noun-inflexions]] is not /Weak masculine/ as in
table [[tbl:old-norse-noun-inflexions]] but /Weak Nouns/. This is due to
weak nouns’ inflexions merging together, yet again due to the final
vowel loss and regularization of these inflexions. Only strong nouns
remain separated, although by minor differences. All nouns get a case
marker /-s/ for singular genitive, /-r/ for plural nominative, and /-um/ for
plural dative. However, strong masculine nouns also get an /-r/ on
singular nominative nouns, strong feminine nouns get an /-r/ on plural
accusative nouns, and strong neuter nouns lose their /-r/ on plural
nominative nouns.

Note also the /-r/ suffix becomes an /-n/ when added to a word ending with
an <n>. For instance, the word /brún/ (/eyebrow/) becomes /brúnn/ in its
plural nominative form instead of /brúnr/.

Case markers are no longer productive and only server for redundancy
with Modern Eittlandic’s syntax. The Royal Academy for Literature,
which authored Standard Eittlandic, even recommends not using them to
simplify the language, as they deemed them no longer necessary for
understanding Eittlandic. While this recommendation is widely adopted
by Standard Eittlandic speakers, singular genitive /-s/ still remains
used even in this dialect.

Eittlandic inherited from Old Norse a gender system divided into three
genders: male, female, and neuter. Due to the presence of declensions
with strong nouns and adjectives, its pronouns, and to a certain
degree different articles, it can still be said Eittlandic is a
gendered language although it doesn’t hold much importance in its
grammar anymore. Since strong nouns aren’t productive anymore and weak
nouns lost all obvious gender differences, we can even consider gender
as not productive anymore in Eittlandic and bound to eventually
disappear.

In case a strong noun is used with a strong adjective, both will agree
in number and gender.

Per /Hawkin’s Universals/:

$Posp \supset ((AdjN \vee RelN \supset DemN\ \& \ NumN\ \& \ PossN)\ \& \ (DemN \vee NumN \vee PossN \supset GenN))$

Adjectives precede nouns, therefore demonstratives, numerals, and
possessives also preceed the noun. Since they do, the language must
also allow genitives to preceed the noun. The only element in the
Postpositional rule that does not precede the noun are relative
clauses.

Eittlandic also has prepositions. Genitive can follow the noun,
therefore relative clauses must follow the noun. Therefore, we have:
| NPosp | DemN | NumN | PossN | AdjN | GenN | NRel |
This is language C as per Artifexian’s [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZJV1C8g-u8PbZIEHp8t7JT8SSyY7ZetEZ5oBJJn0g2U/edit][list of postpositional
