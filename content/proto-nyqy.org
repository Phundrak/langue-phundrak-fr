/Indo-European Language and Culture/ by Benjamin W. Forston. Go read

for the part with the Old Irish and Vedic people and what their kings
and queens did with horses, I wish to unread that).

** Language Evolution
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Introduction-Language-evolution-mpo10x50e5j0
:END:
We are not sure which was the first language ever spoken in our world.
Was there even one primordial language, or were there several that
spontaneously appeared around our world here and there? We cannot know
for certain, this is too far back in our history. Some scientists
estimate the firsts of our kind to be gifted the ability to speak
lived some hundred of thousand of years back, maybe twice this period
even. There is absolutely no way to know what happened at that time
with non-physical activities, and we can only guess. We can better
guess how they lived, and how they died, than how they interacted with
each other, what was their social interaction like, and what were the
first words ever spoken on our planet. Maybe they began as grunts of
different pitches, with hand gestures, then two vowels became
distinct, a couple of consonants, and the first languages sprung from
that. This, we do not know, and this is not the subject of this book
anyways.

What we do know is, languages evolve as time passes. One language can
morph in the way it is pronounced, in the way some words are used, in
the way they are shaped by their position and role in the sentence, by
how they are organized with each other. A language spoken two
centuries back will sound like its decendent today, but with a
noticeable difference. Jumping a couple of centuries back, and we lost
some intelligibility, and some sentences sound alien to us. A
millenium back, and while the language resonates, we cannot understand
it anymore. Going the other way around, travelling to the future,
would have the same effect, except that we would not necessarily
follow only one language, but several, for in different places,
different changes would take place. As time goes by, these differences
become more and more proeminent, and what was once the same langage
becomes several dialects that become less and less similar to one
another, until we end up with several languages, sister between
themselves, daughters to the initial language.

** Relating Languages Between Themselves
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Introduction-Relating-languages-between-themselves-7qp10x50e5j0
:END:
We are not sure who first emited the theory of language evolution;
this has been lost to time during the great collapse two thousand
years back, and only a fraction of the knowledge from back then
survived the flow of time. We’re lucky even to know about this. It’s
the Professor Loqbrekh who, in 3489, first deciphered some books that
were found two decades prior, written in Énanonn. They described the
principle of language evolution, and how language families could be
reconstructed, how we could know languages are related, and a hint on
how mother languages we do not know could be reconstructed. The
principle on how historical linguistics are the following:

#+begin_quote
If two languages share a great number of coincidentally similar
features, especially in their grammar, so much so that it cannot be
explained by chance only, then these two languages are surely related.
#+end_quote

By this process, we can recreate family trees of languages. Some are
more closely related to one another than some other, which are more
distant. Sometimes, it is even unsure if a language is related to a
language tree; maybe the language simply borrowed a good amount of
vocabulary from another language that we either now of, or died since.

The best attested languages are the ones we have written record of. In
a sense, we are lucky: while we do know a vast majority of the written
documents prior to the great collapse were lost during this sad event,
we still have a good amount of them left in various languages we can
analyze, and we still find some that were lost before then and found
back again. The earliest written record we ever found was from the
Loho language, the oldest member of the Mojhal language tree attested;
the Mojhal tree has been itself linked to the Ñyqy tree some fifty
years ago by the Pr Khorlan (3598).

** Principles of Historical Linguistics
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Introduction-Principles-of-historical-linguistics-woq10x50e5j0
:END:
So, how does historical linguistics work? How does one know what the
mother language of a bunch of other languages is? In historical
linguistics, we study the similarities between languages and their
features. If a feature is obviously common, there is a good chance it
is inherited from a common ancestor. The same goes for words, we
generally take the average of several words, we estimate what their
ancestor word was like, and we estimate what sound change made these
words evolve the way they did. If this sound change consistently works
almost always, we know we hit right: sound changes are very regular,
and exceptions are very rare. And this is how we can reconstruct a
mother language that was lost to time thanks to its existing daughter
languages.

But as we go back in time, it becomes harder and harder to get
reliable data. Through evolution, some information is lost --- maybe
there once was an inflectional system that was lost in all daughter
languages, and reconstructing that is nigh impossible. And since no
reconstruction can be attested, we need a way to distinguish these
from attested forms of words. This is why attested words are simply
written like “this”, while reconstructed words are written with a
preceding star like “{{{recon(this)}}}”. Sometimes, to distinguish both from
the text, you will see the word of interest be written either in *bold*
or /italics/. This bears no difference in meaning.

** On Proto-Languages
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Introduction-On-proto-languages-qtr10x50e5j0
:END:
As we go back in time, there is a point at which we have to stop: we
no longer find any related language to our current family, or we can’t
find enough evidence that one of them is part of the family and if
they are related, they are very distantly related. This language we
cannot go beyond is called a proto-language, and it is the mother
language of the current language family tree. In our case, the
Proto-Ñyqy language, spoken by the Ñyqy people, is the mother language
of the Ñyqy language family tree and the ancestor of the more widely
known Mojhal languages.

There is something I want to insist on very clearly: a proto-language
is not a “prototype” language as we might think at first --- it is not
an imperfect, inferior language that still needs some iterations
before becoming a full-fledged language. It has been proven multiple
times multiple times around the world, despite the best efforts of the
researchers of a certain empire, that all languages are equally
complex regardless of ethnicity, education, time, and place. Languages
that are often described as “primitive” are either called so as a way
to indicate they are ancient, and therefore close to a proto-language,
or they are described so by people trying to belittle people based on
incorrect belief that some ethnicities are somehow greater or better
than others. This as well has been proven multiple times that this is
not true. A proto-language bore as much complexity as any of the
languages currently spoken around the world, and a primitive language
in linguistic terms is a language close in time to these
proto-languages, such as the Proto-Mojhal language (which is also in
turn the proto-language of the Mojhal tree). The only reason these
languages might seem simpler is because we do not know them and cannot
know them in their entierty, so of course some features are missing
from it, but they were surely there.

Note that “Proto-Ñyqy” is the usual and most widely accepted spelling
of the name of the language and culture, but other spellings are
accepted such as “Proto Ñy Qy”, “Proto Ñy Ħy”, “Proto Ḿy Qy”, or
“Proto Ḿy Ħy”, each with their equivalent with one word only after the
“Proto” part. As we’ll see below in
§[[#Structural-Preview-Phonetic-Inventory-and-Translitteration-Consonants-xethtyt058j0]],
the actual pronunciation of consonants is extremely uncertain, and
each one of these orthographies are based on one of the possible
pronunciations of the term {{{recon(ñyqy)}}}. In this book, we’ll use the so
called “coronal-only” orthography, unless mentionned otherwise. Some
people also have the very bad habit of dubbing this language and
culture as simply “Ñyqy” (or one of its variants), but this is very
wrong, as the term “Ñyqy” designates the whole familiy of languages
and cultures that come from the Proto-Ñyqy people. The Tiltinian
languages are as much Tiltinian as they are Ñyqy languages, but that
does not mean they are the same as the Proto-Ñyqy language, even if
they are relatively close in terms of time. When speaking about
something that is “Ñyqy”, we are generally speaking about daughter
languages and cultures and not about the Proto-Ñyqy language and
culture itself.

Note also we usually write this language with groups of morphemes,
such as a noun group, as one word like we do with {{{recon(ñyqy)}}}.
However, when needed we might separate the morphemes by a dash, such
as in {{{recon(ñy-qy)}}}.

** Reconstructing the Culture Associated to the Language
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Introduction-On-the-culture-associated-to-the-language-oa3g5660e5j0
:END:
While the comparative method described in
§[[#Introduction-Principles-of-historical-linguistics-woq10x50e5j0]] work
on languages, we also have good reasons to believe they also work of
culture: if elements of different cultures that share a language from
the same family also share similar cultural elements, we have good
reasons to believe these elements were inherited from an earlier stage
of a common culture. This is an entire field of research in its own
right, of course, but linguistics also come in handy when trying to
figure out the culture of the Ñyqy people: the presence of certain
words can indicate the presence of what they meant, while the
impossibility of recreating a word at this stage of the language might
indicate it only appeared in later stages of its evolution, and it
only influenced parts of the decendents of the culture and language.
For instance, the lack of word for “honey” in Proto-Ñyqy but the
ability to reconstruct a separate word for both the northern and
southern branches strongly suggests both branches discovered honey
only after the Proto-Ñyqy language split up into different languages,
and its people in different groups, while the easy reconstruction of
{{{recon(mygú)}}} signifying /monkey/ strongly suggests both branches knew
about this animal well before these two groups split up. More on the
culture in §[[#Culture-of-the-Proto-Ñyqy-People-keflq2i0g5j0]] below.

* Culture of the Proto-Ñyqy People
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Culture-of-the-Proto-Ñyqy-People-keflq2i0g5j0
:END:
While the Proto-Ñyqy is the most well attested cultural and linguistic
family, the temporal distance between the Proto-Ñyqy people and us
makes it extremely hard to reconstruct anything. The various branches
of the Ñyqy family evolved over the past eight to twelve past
millenia, and some changed pretty drastically compared to their
ancestors. Therefore, do not expect an in-depth description of what
their society was like, but rather what could be considered an
overview compared to some other culture descriptions.

** The Name of the Language
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Culture-of-the-Proto-Ñyqy-People-The-Name-of-the-Language-cknak9n0h5j0
:END:
First, it is important to know where the name of this language came
from. Since it has such a wide spread in this world, giving it a name
based on where its daughter branches went would give it a very long
name, or with a shorter one we would have very boring or limited names
--- the “Proto-Northern-Southern” language doesn’t sound very good,
and the “Proto-Mojhal-Andelian” language leaves other major branches
out, such as the Pritian branch which we cannot ommit, just as the
Mojhal and Andelian branches. So, researchers went with the
reconstructed word for the inclusive /we/: {{{recon(ñyqy)}}}. It itself is a
coumpound word made up of {{{recon(ñy)}}}, which is the first person
pronoun, and {{{recon(qy)}}} which is sometimes used as a grammatical
morpheme indicating a plural --- it also means six, as we will later
on, the number system of the Proto-Ñyqy people was a bit complex.

** Geographical Location
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Culture-of-the-Proto-Ñyqy-People-Geographical-Location-fmfkumo0h5j0
:END:
It is often very hard to find the location of very old reconstructed
languages, such as the Proto-Mojhal language itself which location is
still not clearly known despite its name. But when it comes to the
Proto-Ñyqy people, we have a surprisingly good idea of where they
were: in the hot rainforests of the northern main continent, most
probably near nowadays’ Rhesodia. We know this thanks to some of their
reconstructed words which are typical for the other people that lived
or still live in hot rainforests, and these terms are older than the
split between the northern and southern groups. For instance, both
groups have a common ancestor word for /bongo/, {{{recon(zebec)}}}, as well as
for the /bonobo/, {{{recon(pœwec)}}}, which are only found in these
rainforests.

** Society
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Culture-of-the-Proto-Ñyqy-People-Society-g29i52n0h5j0
:END:
The Proto-Ñyqy was a matriachal society, led most likely by older
women who had an important spiritual role. This cultural trait is
found in numerous daughter branches of the Ñyqy family, and it would
be unreasonable to think a large amount of them would change in the
same way despite many branches being most likely disconnected from one
another, and the patriarchal branches almost all retained women as
their spiritual figurehead, even if political power passed in the
hands of men.

** Religion and Beliefs
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Culture-of-the-Proto-Ñyqy-People-Religion-and-beliefs-31mj52n0h5j0
:END:
This question might be the hardest of all to answer, as we can only
speculate based on the religions the daughter cultures of the Ñyqy
family had, as well as the few hints we can get through the Proto-Ñyqy
vocabulary. Through this keyhole, dusted by millenia of cultural and
linguistic changes, we can offer an initial answer. It seems the
Proto-Ñyqy reveered several gods, with however one god or goddes above
them called {{{recon(Qiisci)}}}, that might have been to them some form of
queen or some sort of god for the gods themselves. We can find for
instance this figure in the Mojhal patheon under the name of Kísce.
Other than the parental figure of this divinity, their role is vastly
unknown.

Proto-Ñyqy is a language that appears to be strongly analytical and
isolating. It relies mainly on its syntax when it comes to its grammar
and seldom on morphological rules if at all. It wouldn’t really make
much sense to say whether the language is postpositional or
prepositional since the only rule defined in Hawkin’s Universals
Proto-Ñyqy respects is relative clauses and possessives before the
noun, though it tends to make Proto-Ñyqy slightly more postpositional
than neutral. Most of its words contain either one or two syllables
and its sentenses often revolve around linked morphemes which could be
interpreted as grammatical particules. You can find some examples of
Proto-Ñyqy and its translation below as well as its glossing.
1. {{{recon(yq ñe pom qy)}}}
   | yq        | ñe   | pom | qy       |
   | dem.prox3 | home | GEN | 1sg(ABS) |

2. {{{recon(cø ne)}}}
   | cø            | ñe         |
   | 1sg.POSS.INCL | house(ABS) |

3. {{{recon(pim bú qi coq op)}}}
   | pim   | bú       | qi | coq | op  |
   | mango | 2sg(ERG) | DU | eat | PST |
   We (two) ate a mango
4. {{{recon(cø pim i bœ mygú coq ug mún op zø qy zúmu op)}}}
   | cø       | pim   | i              | bœ      | mygú        | coq | ug   | mún  | op  |
   | POSS.1sg | mango | undef.art(ABS) | def.art | monkey(ERG) | eat | SUBJ | PROG | PST |

   | 3sg(ABS) | 1sg(ERG) | see  | PST |
   I saw the monkey that would have been eating a mango of mine

In the first and second examples, we can notice the absence of a verb
“to be” or any equivalent, this shows existential predicates did not
need a verb in order to express the existance of something and its
attributes. This also reveals the word order of the genitive form in
Proto-Ñyqy, the genitive particle follows the element it propertizes
and is followed by its property. For instance, in {{{recon(yq ñe pom qy)}}},
{{{recon(yq ñe)}}} “this house” has the property of being mine {{{recon(qy)}}} is
the first person singular). /I/ characterize /this house/, therefore /this
house is of me/, /this is my house/. The main difference between the
first and the second examples is the first example is the accent in
the first example is on the fact that said house is /mine/, whereas in
the second example “my house” is simply presented to the interlocutor.

As you can see in the third example, Proto-Ñyqy used to have a dual
number which has been lost in most of its decendent languages, and the
remaining languages employ the former dual as their current plural
dissmissing instead the old plural. Only does the Énanon keep it with
its plural, using the former dual as a paucal. As indicated by its
name, the dual was used when referencing to two elements when an
otherwise greater amount of elements would have required the plural.
Hence, in this example, you could consider {{{recon(bú qi)}}} to be kind of
a 2DU pronoun.
# --- it is actually a bit more complex than that, as we’ll see in
# chapter
# [[#Structural-Preview-Structure-of-a-Nominal-Group-Numbers-n0a6umu058j0]].

Finally, the fourth example gives us an overview of Proto-Ñyqy syntax,
such as a different position depending on whether we use an indefinite
or definite article, as well as a subclause inserted in the main
clause defining a noun phrase, here {{{recon(zø)}}} refering to {{{recon(mygú)}}}.
We can also clearly see the word order of main clauses presented as
Patient-Agent-Verb. Although most of its are nominative languages,
Aarlerte (3652) postulates in her recent papers Proto-Ñyqy might have
been primarily ergative. The loss of this trait in its closest
descendent languages such as Proto-Mojhal-Andelian and Proto-Tiltinian
might indicate this feature was already unstable in Proto-Ñyqy.
Ergativity might have been in use only in main clauses, and Aarlerte
argues this might have been the last trace of ergativity in an
otherwise nominative language.

Note that although linguists suppose Proto-Ñyqy was a mostly
analytical language, some people like to write related morphemes
together as one word, hyphenated or not. Thus, the third example could
also be written as {{{recon(pim búqi coqop)}}} or {{{recon(pim bú-qi coq-op)}}} by
some. It is due to the fact Proto-Ñyqy was for a long time thought to
be an agglutinative language like Proto-Mojhal-Andelian and the habit
of writing related morphemes as one word stuck around. However,
nowadays we know an analytical Proto-Ñyqy is instead most likely and
scolars began writing morphenes separated from each other instead.

We also have a ninth vowel, noted <ə> which denotes an unknown vowel.
It is most likely this was before the Proto-Ñyqy breakup a simple
schwa standing where a vowel got reduced either at an earlier stage
than Proto-Ñyqy or during the breakup of the language. Depending on
the languages that evolved from Proto-Ñyqy, some got rid of it later
while some other reinstated it as a full vowel with different rules
each on which vowel it would become. Thus in the current stage of
reasearch on Proto-Ñyqy, we cannot know for certain which vowel it
should have been.

It is however possible to create a featural tree for the known vowels,
determining which would have been considered closer to others, as
seens with figure [[tree:vowels]].

*** Consonants
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Structural-Preview-Phonetic-Inventory-and-Translitteration-Consonants-xethtyt058j0
:END:
The topic of consonants, unlike vowels, is a hot debate among
linguists. while we are pretty sure proto-ñyqy has twelve consonants,
we are still unsure which consonants they are due to the extreme
unstability of the dorsal feature, and there is seemingly no
consistency as to how the consonants stabilized in the different
languages that emerged from the proto-ñyqy breakup. it is only in the
recent years Ishy Maeln proposed a new theory that is gaining traction
among proto-ñyqy specialists: each consonant could be pronounced
either as a dorsal or as a non-dorsal depending on its environment and
both potential pronunciation can be correct. she even goes further and
proposes proto-ñyqy had an alternating rule stating a given consonant
had to be non-dorsal if the previous one was, and vice versa. this
would explain the common pattern of dorsal consonants alternation
found in some early languages found after the breakup such as
proto-mojhal. this phenomenon is more thouroughly explained in
§[[#Structural-Preview-Phonetic-Inventory-and-Translitteration-Consonants-xethtyt058j0]].

You can find the featural tree of the Proto-Ñyqy consonants in the
figure [[tree:cons]]. Each grapheme displays below its dorsal
pronunciation on the left and its non-dorsal pronunciation on the
right.

As you can see, each one of the consonants have their two alternative
indicated below their grapheme. In the case of the coronal consonants,
the alternative consonant is obtained by replacing the anterior
feature by the dorsal feature when it is present.

The way of writing consonants was therefore standardized as presented
in the table [[table:consonants-pronunciation]].

For each of these consonants, the letter chosen represents what we
suppose was the most common or the default pronunciation of the
consonant represented. In the table are also included alternate
graphemes you might find in other, mostly older works, though they are
mostly deprecated now.

As you can see, Proto-Ñyqy had potentially two different consonants
that could be pronounced as {{{phon(*m)}}}. Although it did not influence
Proto-Ñyqy as far as we know, it definitively influenced the Pritian
branch of the family, with <ñ> and <m> influencing differently the
vowel following it.

Several consonants used to be unknown at the beginnings of the
Proto-Ñyqy study, as can be seen with the old usage of <h_{1}, h_{2}, r_{1},
r_{2}, r_{3}, r_{4}, and r_{5}>. These are found mostly in the earlier documents
but progressively dissapear as our understanding of the Proto-Ñyqy
grew during the past century. They are not used anymore, but any
student that wishes to read older documents on Proto-Ñyqy should be
aware of these.

*** Pitch and Stress
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Structural-Overview-Phonetic-Inventory-and-Translitteration-Pitch-and-Stress-br8ank61e8j0
:END:
It is definitively known Proto-Ñyqy had a stress system that was used
both on a clause and on a word level, as the languages that evolved
from it inherited this characteristic. However, it is not possible to
reconstruct it accurately, we only know the vowel <ə> was unstressed
and only appeared in words with two syllables or more. However, we do
not know if it had any morphological meaning or if it was productive.

On the other hand, we are much less sure about whether it had a pitch
system, and if it did whether it was productive or not. Most of the
languages that evolved from Proto-Ñyqy had or have one such as the
Mojhal-Andelian family, but some don’t such as the Pritian family. The
most commonly accepted answer is a pitch system appeared after the
breakup of the pitchless branches which happenned earlier than the
other branches which do have a pitch system. In reconstructed
Proto-Ñyqy however, if such a system was present, pitches were most
likely non-phonemic and unproductive. It only gained productivity in
later stages, after the first breakups we know, in a common unknown
ancestor language of the branches which did or still do have either an
accent or a pitch system, and even there the evolutions seem to have
happened in different ways depending on the branches. It is therefore
impossible to know what the pitch system of Proto-Ñyqy was if it had
one.

** Phonotactics
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Structural-Preview-Phonotactics-r2whtyt058j0
:END:
*** Syllable Structure
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Structural-Overview-Phonotactics-Syllable-Structure-hhx3zk40f8j0
:END:
The prototypical syllable in Proto-Ñyqy appears as a (C)V(C)(C)
syllable with at least one consonant around the vowel, either in the
onset or in the coda. At most, it can have one consonant in the onset
and two in the coda.

No special rule have been found to rule the onset, it can host any
consonant without any effect on the vowel.

However, it has been found the coda has some rules:
- two nasal consonants cannot follow each other --- no {{{recon(-ñm)}}}
- two coronal consonants cannot follow each other --- no {{{recon(-ns)}}}
- labial consonants are never found with another consonant in the coda
  --- no {{{recon(-ps)}}}
For instance, {{{recon(noc zebec)}}} would be pronounced as {{{recon(noc
gebec)}}}. It is most likely the features to chose from when converting a
consonant from a coronal to a non-coronal were considered as absent by
default. This results in the table
[[table:coronal-to-non-coronal-consonants]] --- as you can see, the pair
<z> and <j> and the pair <s> and <c> convert to the same consonant
respectively.
#+name: table:coronal-to-non-coronal-consonants
#+caption: Conversion Table of Coronal to Non-Coronal Consonants
|        <c>        |          <c>          |
| Coronal Consonant | Non-Coronal Consonant |
|-------------------+-----------------------|
|         n         |           ñ           |
|         z         |           g           |
|         s         |           q           |
|         j         |           g           |
|         c         |           q           |

It has also been found that if two coronal consonants do follow each
other in cross-syllabic environments, with the first one in the coda
of a first syllable and the second one in the onset of a second
syllable, then the former will become voiced as the latter.

Similarly, if two nasal consonants are found near each other in a
cross-syllabic environment, the second nasal consonant will become
denasalized. Thus, we get the conversion table
[[table:consonants-denasalization]].
#+name: table:consonants-denasalization

|        ñ        |          b          |

It has also been found a schwa tends to appear between syllables when
the first one ends with two consonants and the second one begins with
one.

*** Consonantal Dorsal Alternation

As mentioned above in
§[[#Structural-Preview-Phonetic-Inventory-and-Translitteration-Consonants-xethtyt058j0]],
it seems probable according to Maeln’s theory consonants were
alternating between dorsals and non-dorsals. We do not know if it only
happened between words, within words, or along whole clauses, but this
would explain much of the different languages that evolved from
Proto-Ñyqy. Table [[table:word-consonantal-dorsal-alternation]] shows
different possible pronunciation of Proto-Ñyqy words with word-wise
consonantal dorsal alternation whether the first consonant is to be
considered a dorsal consonant or not. Note the nasal switch as well as
the extra schwa insertion in the third example as described above in
chapter

** Word Structure
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Structural-Preview-Word-Structure-n6vhtyt058j0
:END:
Words in Proto-Ñyqy belong to one of two categories: either a bound
morphene, or a free morpheme. The former have a restricted use and
must be used in certain contexts and do not mean anything by
themselves. In Proto-Ñyqy, they are most of the time grammatical
morphemes, for instance for marking the genitive between two words or
the tense of a verb. Although the morpheme is bound, it does not mean
it is part of another word --- it will still be most of the time a
full fledged word obeying the phonological rules of a whole word.

On the other hand, free morphemes do not require another morpheme to
exist. The most basic example is the sentence {{{recon(*ñe)}}} which means
/“It is a house”/. It is also the word for /“house”/ by itself. All nouns
in Proto-Ñyqy are free morphemes, although they can act as bound
morphemes if need be such as when they act as adjectives.

Among multi-syllable world, it is not rare to find compound world made
from other known root words. Generally, the order of the new word
roughly follows the adjective order, however some words might reflect
short noun phrases that became over time a word by itself through
abbreviation with for instance {{{recon(zosøwe)}}} (/shawl/, /veil/) composed of
{{{recon(zoc)}}} and {{{recon(søwe)}}}. This term is most likely the abbreviation
of {{{recon(zoc pom søwe)}}}, or /head fabric/. Phonetic rules on abbreviation
in Proto-Ñyqy are unfortunately very much unknown with no consensus
reached on this point, most of them might be older innovations.

Names in Proto-Ñyqy generally refer to defined entities, such as
objects, people, concepts, or events. They do not have any
morphological characteristics, they remain constant. However, they can
associate with each other and act as adjectives. More on that in
§[[#Structural-Preview-World-Classes-Modifiers-Descriptive-Adjectives-pcpelau058j0]].
They are the center of the noun phrase, of which they are head-first.
Noun phrases can be found as agents or patients of a sentence, but
they can also be found in genitive and dative constructions.

The nouns could most likely take genitive pronouns, but how they
interacted exactly is yet unsure. The
