Sorry, but no. Maybe one day I’ll make it so that people can sort of participate
with the  development of some  of my languages,  but as for  now I wish  to work
alone on these projects.

In any case, feedback is more than welcomed, and you can either open
issues or send me emails at [[mailto:lucien@phundrak.com]], I’ll be more
than happy to talk and chat about these conlangs!
